# EATA_project
As a consequence of cyclone Yaku and the disasters that occurred in several regions of Peru, UNI's Center for Information and Communication Technologies (CTIC) launched the EATA project, which seeks to alert citizens about possible meteorological phenomena throughout the country. Its main objective is to develop an artificial intelligence model to prevent natural disasters related to weather events. This initiative seeks to use technology to provide protection and security to the population in emergency situations.

## First phase
At this stage, our goal is to understand how geostationary satellite imagery data is used, as well as the ability to segment these images and investigate the different servers from which these images can be extracted.

Thus we have begun to collect a three-month dataset that includes four GOES imagery products. These images are automatically downloaded from a web page as a quick response to display images in real time.

To this end, we have created a live stream on YouTube to showcase these four products and provide explanations of current events that are occurring in the country. Through this live broadcast, we provide real-time information on the current situation in the country, accompanied by a detailed explanation of each of the image products.
